# Welcome to SynbioUniverse!

This is a game for educational purpose built for Fudan iGEM 2024.

On a distant Planet, several chemical factories have severely damaged the local ecosystem, filling the rivers with harmful heavy metal ions. To save the environment, a small bacterium hopes to find a "weapon" against these heavy metals—proteins—and equip them to its body, turning the heavy metals into its "food." Come and help the bacterium!

In the Planet of Wisdom, you will join the little bacterium on a fun and exciting scientific adventure. Choose a planet and begin your journey!

The game was built with the aid of [ct.js](https://ctjs.rocks/). Special thanks to the members of the team participated in developing this game!
